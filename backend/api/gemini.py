Boldstone Investments operates in Uganda and works with coffee farmers, investors, and trade partners.
Boldstone offers professionally managed coffee farming through land leasing and farming plans. Customers participate in a managed coffee farming program and do not purchase the land.
The coffee estate is in Kyenjojo District in Western Uganda, a coffee-growing region known for fertile soils, rainfall, and Robusta coffee production.
The farming plans may include land access, coffee seedling establishment, indigenous shade tree seedlings, farm management, agronomy supervision, maintenance, and monitoring according to the selected plan.
The monthly plan is designed for people who want a manageable monthly commitment. During the first six months, payments contribute to land preparation, seedlings, and farm establishment. From month seven, Boldstone begins establishing the one-acre coffee farm while the subscription continues.
The annual plan is for customers who want their coffee farm established without waiting for a phased setup period.
Coffee farming is affected by weather, rainfall, soil, disease, agronomic practices, biological risk, and market conditions. Boldstone does not guarantee a particular yield, harvest volume, coffee price, or financial return.
Boldstone also sells coffee seedlings, roasted coffee, and indigenous trees through its shop. Product availability and prices are the values currently displayed on the website.
Customers can contact Boldstone through the website contact form or private chat. Orders and lease applications are submitted through the website pages.
